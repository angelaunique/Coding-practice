/*207. Course Schedule

Share
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

 

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 

Constraints:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
1 <= numCourses <= 10^5*/



/*only case fail: cycle. If no cycles,Directed Acyclic Graph, use DFS to check dependencies( neighbors) we incrementally follow the dependencies until either there is no more dependency or we come across a previously visited course along the path.
 adjacency list data,
 Step 1). we build a graph data structure from the given list of course dependencies. Here we adopt the adjacency list data structure as shown below to represent the graph, which can be implemented via hashmap or dictionary. Each entry in the adjacency list represents a node which consists of a node index and a list of neighbors nodes that follow from the node.
 Step 2). we then enumerate each node (course) in the constructed graph, to check if we could form a dependency cycle starting from the node.
