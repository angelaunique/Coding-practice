/*

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.



Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

Example:

Input: 4
Output: [
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.

/* method1: constrained programming. 
    That basically means to put restrictions after each queen placement. One puts a queen on the board and that immediately excludes one column, one row and two diagonals for the further queens placement. That propagates constraints and helps to reduce the number of combinations to consider.*/

/*
backtrack(row = 0).

Start from the first row = 0.

Iterate over the columns and try to put a queen in each column.

    If square (row, column) is not under attack

        Place the queen in (row, column) square.
        Exclude one row, one column and two diagonals from further consideration.
        If all rows are filled up row == N
        That means that we find out one more solution.
    Else
        Proceed to place further queens backtrack(row + 1).
    Now backtrack : remove the queen from (row, column) square.
*/

/*Time complexity : \mathcal{O}(N!)O(N!). There is N possibilities to put the first queen, not more than N (N - 2) to put the second one, not more than N(N - 2)(N - 4) for the third one etc. In total that results in \mathcal{O}(N!)O(N!) time complexity.
Space complexity : \mathcal{O}(N)O(N) to keep an information about diagonals and rows.*/
